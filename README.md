## ðŸš€ Architecture
![ScreenShot](/docs/arch.png)

## ðŸ”¥ Features

1. Create a campaign with a name and a target info (URL, phone number, etc)
2. Generate a QR code for the campaign
3. Track the scans of the QR code and save the information in the database like the user agent, the time of the scan, and the location of the scan
4. Redirect the user to the target URL or the app which related to the campaign
5. Track the user's behavior in the company's website or app and measure the conversion rate
6. Export Statistics of the campaign related scans like the number of scans from each country, the number of scans from each device, the number of scans from each browser, and the number of scans from each OS
7. protect the service from the `DDOS` attack by using `Rate Limiting` and use helmets to protect the service from `XSS` and `CSRF` attacks by setting the collection of headers

## ðŸ”« Flow of the service

1. User creates a campaign with a name and a target info (URL, phone number, etc)
2. User generates a QR code for the campaign
    + Get id of the campaign
    + Get URL which related to the campaign
    + Generate QR code with the URL
    + Shares the QR code with Users
3. User scans the QR code
4. QR code scanner sends a request to the backend Service with the campaign id
5. Backend Service Save the information of the scan in the database
6. Backend Service check the agent of the request
    + If the agent is a browser, redirect the user to the target URL
    + If the agent is a mobile app, redirect the user to App which related to the campaign
    + this redirection contain uuid of the user which scanned the QR code and the token of this user 
7. After user redirected to the company's website or app, the company can track the user's behavior and measure the conversion rate
8. Any Event happens in the company's website or app, the company can send this event to the backend service with the uuid of the user and token of the user for authentication which stored in the redis to make service `stateless`

## Set Environment Variables

your environment variables should be like this

```bash
SERVICE_NAME=AdvertisementCampaignsService
SERVICE_VERSION=1.0.0
SERVICE_HOST=0.0.0.0
SERVICE_PORT=8000
SERVICE_BASE_PATH=/api/v1
SERVICE_MODE=development
SERVICE_LOG_DIR=logs
SERVICE_LOG_FILE=access.log
MONGO_DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
MONGO_DB_PORT=27017
MONGO_DB_NAME=advertisements
MONGO_DB_USER=root
MONGO_DB_PASS=rootpassword
ADMIN_EMAIL=youssef@gmail.com   
ADMIN_PASSWORD=123456
JWT_SECRET=secret
QRCODE_ENDPOINT=http://192.168.1.3:8000/api/v1/qrcode/redirection
ADECOMPANY_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:8002
REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PORT=6379
```
we can explain the environment variables as follows
+ `SERVICE_NAME` : the name of the service
+ `SERVICE_VERSION` : the version of the service
+ `SERVICE_HOST` : the host of the service
+ `SERVICE_PORT` : the port of the service
+ `SERVICE_BASE_PATH` : the base path of the service
+ `SERVICE_MODE` : the mode of the service `development` or `production`
+ `SERVICE_LOG_DIR` : the directory of the logs
+ `SERVICE_LOG_FILE` : the name of the log file
+ `MONGO_DB_HOST` : the host of the MongoDB
+ `MONGO_DB_PORT` : the port of the MongoDB
+ `MONGO_DB_NAME` : the name of the MongoDB database
+ `MONGO_DB_USER` : the user of the MongoDB
+ `MONGO_DB_PASS` : the password of the MongoDB
+ `ADMIN_EMAIL` : the email of the admin
+ `ADMIN_PASSWORD` : the password of the admin
+ `JWT_SECRET` : the secret of the JWT
+ `QRCODE_ENDPOINT` : the endpoint of the QR code service
   - because i run service with local i should run server is `0.0.0.0` to make it accessible from wan network so this end point is ip of the server in wan network you can get it by `ip a s` command
+ `ADECOMPANY_ENDPOINT` : the endpoint of the campaign company service we make it as demo in `frontend/ade_company_web` directory
